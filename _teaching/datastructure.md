The course aims to provide in-depth knowledge of abstract data types and algorithm design for solving computer science problems.

**Learning objectives**

After completing the course, the student should:
1. be able to use abstract data types in programming tasks

2. be able to define and implement abstract data types based on informal problem descriptions

3. be able to implement algorithms based on descriptions in pseudocode

4. be sufficiently familiar with some common algorithms for sorting and searching which implement a previously unknown variant of the algorithm based on an informal description of the change

5. know the concept of time complexity, and be able to calculate the time complexity 

6. be sufficiently familiar with some specific abstract data types to be able to add operations to them if necessary. Examples of such abstract data types are binary trees, dynamic lists, direct access lists, various search data structures, graphs

**Content**
Abstract data types, dynamic data structures, searching and sorting algorithms, algorithm complexity.
