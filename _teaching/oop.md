This course aims to provide a deep understanding of the object-oriented (OO) design of computer programs so that students utilize the related concepts in solving computer science problems. 

The following concepts are included in this course:
- The basic principles of OO design
- Modular decomposition of the problems (Classes, objects, field, modifiers, methods, constructors, etc)
- Inheritance and Subtype polymorphism (reusing the OO design) 
- Static and dynamic binding, method and data hiding, Static methods, Overloading
- Advanced concepts such as generics, Delegates, Events, Exceptions, abstract classes and interfaces, Operator overloading, etc.
- Various design patterns
